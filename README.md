# JuniorAngularTestapp

This project implements an Angular front-end that retrieves data from BitPanda API endpoint. Visualizes specific data such as 'Commodities', Cryptocoins', Indexes and Fiats from the received data in html tables. 

## Features of this project

In this project, I have implemented a simple 'search' field and a 'sort' field using angular pipes. In additon, I have combined string interpolation and structural directives to display data inside html tables. Moreover, I have made use of RouterModule to achieve menubar navigation. Also, I have stored the received data in local storage so that to use it future for INDEXED DB implementation. For over all and table styling I have used Bootstrap latest version 4.5.
